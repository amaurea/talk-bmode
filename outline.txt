* Observing gravitaitonal waves
	* induced T-modes (GW ISW)
	* cosmic variance
	* induced E- and B-modes (SW * thomson)
		* Q,U and E,B definition figure
	* (de-)lensing
	* maps and power spectra
	* Single wave packet examples?
* Observations
	* T: (cobe?), wmap, planck, etc. (and high-L to fix slope, i.e. ACT, SPT)
	* B: QUIET, BICEP etc. Use figure of experiments so far
	* Tension between T and B for standard model
* Observational difficulties
	* lensing
	* instrument systematics
	* foregrounds (dust!)
* Upcoming experiments
	* Must check literature
	* Planck, SPT, (Adv)Actpol, KECK+BICEP 3, SPIDER?
* Non-CMB tests
	* Direct detection
